# Leveraging auto-generated documentation

Alis Build OS provides out-of-the-box documentation for products built on the platform. This documentation consists of API reference documentation auto-generated directly from the protocol buffers, custom user guides and code samples which teams may compile to provide greater assistance to clients.

In this guide, we aim to give you the necessary background to leverage this documentation service.

::: tip
**Before you start**
1. [Download and install the Alis Build OS CLI](/guides/configuration/command-line-interface);
2. Ensure you are part of an existing organisation and product on Build OS;
3. Have pulled the latest version of your organisation's protos by running `alis org get {yourOrg}`.
:::

## Overview

The product documentation is generated by parsing the following files in the relevant product directory of your organisation's `proto` repo:
1. The `resources` and `services` proto files which are used to generate the reference documentation based on the contents of each proto file as per their latest release (`alis proto release`).
2. The custom markdown files contained within the `docs` folder, used to generate the landing page, guides and samples.
```
proto
├──{orgID}
│   └── {productID}
│       ├── docs/.../*.md
│       ├── resources/.../*.proto
│       └── services/.../*.proto
```

Once the documentation has been released, it will be publicly available at [https://docs.{productID}.{orgDomain}](https://docs.de.alis.services) (eg. [https://docs.de.alis.services](https://docs.de.alis.services)).

## Updating reference documentation

The reference documentation component is generated from the proto files. The emphasis on the definition first-approach ensures that the effort is focussed on the design of the protos with detailed comments above the various services, methods, messages and fields and this design is then propagated into the reference documentation for the APIs.

::: danger 
A current caveat is that the use of certain Markdown syntax in your comments may result in invalid Markdown syntax in the generated documentation, causing the build of your documentation to fail. This is primarily the usage of the “|” character in your proto comments as well as using line breaks in links.
:::

## Writing guides and samples

The initial state (after a product creation) of the `docs` directory should resemble the folder structure depicted below, ie. must then have an `index.md` file at the root of `docs` as well as `guides`, `reference` and `samples` sub-directories each containing an `index.md` directory.

```
docs
├── index.md
├── guides
│   └──index.md
├── reference
│   └── index.md
└── samples
│   └── index.md
└── index.md
```

The `index.md` file at the root directory, serves as the landing page for the documentation site and can be customised using the (VitePress Home Page theme)[https://vitepress.vuejs.org/guide/theme-home-page#home-page]. The other `index.md` files is the respective page that will be opened when the `guides`, `reference` and `samples` navigation tab is opened on the site.

Any subdirectory added under `guides` and `samples` will be converted into a heading in the documentation navigation sidebar, it's depth being determined by the file structure. Markdown files can then be placed inside either the root or any of the subdirectories of `guides` and `samples` and will be added to the documentation sidebar. An example file structure and the resulting documentation navigation sidebar for the `guides` section is depicted below.


```
├── guides
│   ├── how-to-guides
│   │   ├── first_screening.md
│   │   └── getting_started.md
│   ├── index.md
│   ├── quick-starts
│   │   └── some_quick_start.md
│   ├── some-cool-directory
│   │   └── cool-content.md
│   └── tutorials
│       ├── advanced
│       │   ├── sub_file1.md
│       │   └── sub_file2.md
│       ├── main_file.md
│       └── sub_file1.md
├── index.md
├── reference
│   └── index.md
└── samples
    ├── code_sample_1.md
    ├── index.md
```
![](./img/docs-folder-structure.png)


The titles used in the sidebar is derived from the `title` field in the [file's YAML Frontmatter](https://vitepress.vuejs.org/guide/frontmatter). For example, the `guides/how-to-guides/first_screening.md` file, the YAML Frontmatter would be:

```yaml
---
title: Conduct your first screening
---

{Your file content}
...
```

Content to be generated on the documentation page should follow the Frontmatter.

::: tip
Since our documentation uses [VitePress](https://vitepress.vuejs.org/) under the hood, you can leverage the functionality of VitePress [Markdown Extensions](https://vitepress.vuejs.org/guide/markdown) and to get the most out of your documentation.

## Deploying documentation

Alis Build OS runs a nightly build and release of all product documentation as well as provides a means to manually update documentation. These are discussed in the following sections.

### Auto-generated nightly release

The nightly build of all product documentation will reflect:
1. The reference documentation of the last released protocol buffers;
2. The state of the documentation in the repo's `master` branch when the build is kicked off.

::: Warning
It is essential that documentation that is present in the master branch is production ready.
:::

### Manual release

Cases exist where teams may want to deploy a new version of the documentation, such as: adding new documentation pages, updating protocol buffers or making fixes to existing pages. To run a manual release, the [Alis Build CLI](/guides/configuration/command-line-interface) will be used and the following steps can be followed:

1. Ensure the all the markdown files in the docs folder have been committed and pushed to the master branch;
2. Ensure you have released the most up-to-date protos in terms of their content and commentary;
3. In your terminal, run the `alis docs release` command and specify the product (`{orgID}.{productID}`). Example:

```bash
$ alis docs release play.dm
```
 
4. The documentation will be available at: https://docs.{productID}.{orgDomain}(https://docs.de.alis.services)

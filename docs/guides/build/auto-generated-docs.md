# Leveraging the documentation service

Alis Build OS provides out-of-the-box documentation for products built on the platform. This documentation consists of API reference documentation auto-generated directly from the protocol buffers, custom user guides and code samples which teams may compile to provide greater assistance to clients.

In this guide, we aim to give you the necessary background to leverage this documentation service.

::: tip
**Before you start**
1. [Download and install the Alis Build OS CLI](/guides/configuration/command-line-interface);
2. Ensure you are part of an existing organisation and product on Build OS;
3. Have pulled the latest version of your organisation's protos by running `alis org get {yourOrg}`
:::

## Overview

The product documentation is generated by parsing the following files in the relevant product directory of your organisation's `proto` repo:
1. The `resources` and `services` proto files which are used to generate the reference documentation based on the contents of each proto file as per their latest release (`alis proto release`).
2. The custom markdown files contained within the `docs` folder, used to generate the landing page, guides and samples.
```
proto
├──{orgID}
│   └── {productID}
│       ├── docs/.../*.md
│       ├── resources/.../*.proto
│       └── services/.../*.proto
```

Once the documentation has been released, it will be publicly available at [https://docs.{productID}.{orgDomain}](https://docs.de.alis.services) (eg. [https://docs.de.alis.services](https://docs.de.alis.services).

## Updating reference documentation

The reference documentation component is generated from the proto files. The emphasis on the definition first-approach ensures that the effort is focussed on the design of the protos with detailed comments above the various services, methods, messages and fields and this design is then propagated into the reference documentation for the APIs.

::: danger 
A current caveat is that the use of certain Markdown syntax in your comments may result in invalid Markdown syntax in the generated documentation, causing the build of your documentation to fail. This is primarily the usage of the “|” character in your proto comments as well as using line breaks in links.

## Writing guides and samples

The initial state (after a product creation) of the `docs` directory should resemble the folder structure depicted below, ie. must then have an `index.md` file at the root of `docs` as well as `guides`, `reference` and `samples` sub-directories each containing an `index.md` directory.
```
docs
├── index.md
├── guides
│   └──index.md
├── reference
│   └── index.md
└── samples
└── index.md
```

You can customise the index.md for each section as you’d like, including the index.md at the root of the docs folder which is the landing page for your docs. You can create any subdirectories you desire within the provided `guides`, `reference` and `samples` subdirectories. The generated docs will then provide sections and pages that directly reflect your folder structure and markdown files. For example:

```
.
├── guides
│   ├── how-to-guides
│   │   ├── first_screening.md
│   │   └── getting_started.md
│   ├── index.md
│   ├── quick-starts
│   │   └── some_quick_start.md
│   ├── some-cool-directory
│   │   └── cool-content.md
│   └── tutorials
│       ├── advanced
│       │   ├── sub_file1.md
│       │   └── sub_file2.md
│       ├── main_file.md
│       └── sub_file1.md
├── index.md
├── reference
│   └── index.md
└── samples
├── code_sample_1.md
└── index.md
```
![](./img/docs-folder-structure.png)

An important thing, to note however, is that the title of the individual markdown files does not map to the name of the .md file. It rather makes use of the YAML Frontmatter defined in the .md file. In `first_screening.md` for example, the YAML Frontmatter would be:
```yaml
---
title: Conduct your first screening
---
```
And the content of the article would follow afterwards. Since our documentation makes use of Vitepress behind the scenes, you can get more information about YAML Frontmatter and Vitepress at https://vitepress.vuejs.org

## Deploying your documentation
1. Once you are happy with the state of your markdown files in the docs folder, push your changes to master.
2. Ensure you have released the most up-to-date protos in terms of their content and commentary
3. Run `alis docs release {orgID}.{productID}`
4. The documentation will be available at: https://docs.{productID}.{orgDomain}(https://docs.de.alis.services)

# Welcome to our team ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the team! ðŸŽ‰ Whether you're a student, an intern or a colleague,
joining a new work environment can be quite overwhelming.

In order to ease your first days and set you up for the future,
we have put together guide (well, we are sort of still in the process) and
hope that you will find it useful.

The goal of this document is to help you understand how we think and operate. It is however possible that
some advice or things here might at first seem weird or useless.
Trust us though, it will probably become handy some day ðŸ˜‰

If you come across anything that needs to be updated or something that does not make sense,
feel free to edit it on GitHub and submit a pull request, or reach out to any of your colleagues.

Otherwise, any minor issue can build up and create unnecessary stress or problems.

>I sent a message but nobody answered...

Send us a reminder (after a reasonable time). There's usually a lot going on so it happens
that we miss or skip things. It's not against you, and we'll be thankful that you reminded us.

## Get Started!

We are advocates for learning by doing. Our aim is to get you set up and write your first code
as quick as possible, giving information as you go along to help you understand what you are doing.

Let's go!

### Device configuration

1. Install the [Alis CLI](command-line-interface.md)
2. [Configure your IDE](/guides/how-to-guides/configure-your-IDE) - please install [Goland](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/download/). Message your team lead about getting a license. For now you can use the trial.

### Intro to Alis Build

Please work through each of the pages in the _Getting Started_. These are described a bit more below:

- [Introduction](introduction.md)

[Here](introduction.md) we give an overview of Alis Build, the engine that powers our ability to innovate and build
world-class software.

You will make use of the CLI to build your first API using Alis Build ðŸŽ‰

- [Conceptual Framework](conceptual-framework.md)

Now that you have built an API, the question becomes how do we scale our build process across
teams and still keep things simple. We have defined some core resources that allow us to structure
what we build in a simple manner. [This guide](conceptual-framework.md) explores these core concepts.

- [Developer Flow](developer-flow.md)

This is where the bigger flow around the build process comes
in. [This guide](developer-flow.md) provides some context in the process you will follow on a regular basis.

:::tip Fun Fact
In a period of 12 months, the Alis Exchange team of 14 people built around 340 services using
this exact flow!
:::

- [Resource-oriented design](/guides/references/resource-oriented-design)

Our way of thinking has been largely shaped by the resource-oriented design pattern. [This page](/guides/references/resource-oriented-design) explores
the core concepts around this design pattern

- [Core technologies](/guides/references/core-technologies)

[Check this out](/guides/references/core-technologies) to understand a bit more about the core technologies we make use of.

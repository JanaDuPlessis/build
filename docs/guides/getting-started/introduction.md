# Welcome to the Alis Build OS

>**_"Our job as builders is to create the world as it could be."_** - <a href="https://farmerandfarmer.org/mastery/builder.html" target="_blank">Sep Kamvar</a>

**Build OS** is a platform that enables individuals and organisations to transform ideas into scalable, enterprise-grade digital services.

High-quality software needs to be scalable, readily accessible, secure, easy-to-use and interoperable with other digital services. The costs and expertise associated with these requirements are exacting, particularly at scale, which present high barriers to entry for individuals and organisations.

The technologies and standards already exist to lower these barriers, but they are disjointed and require a lot of effort to consolidate and effectively leverage before the value is realised. We have done the work of thinking through these complex problems, identifying the best-in-class open-source technologies and standards, and brought these together for the users of Build OS.

Our aim is to empower anyone to create value for their organisation by democratising cloud software engineering, simplifying building, consuming and selling interoperable digital services.
